// Gallery page

<Header>

<gallery>
Would be planning to have a rotating gallery of different types off pizzas

<p>Name and description<p>

The gallery would rotate to the next image on a timer but would also have arrows for user to click

The images would be in a folder stored in the repo or in a database or image container
